        <p class="fs-5 m-3">
          My name is Michael Allgeier. I am currently a student at Ranken Technical College pursuing an Associates of
          Technology Degree in Application and Web Development. I've enjoyed programming and coding ever since I
          discovered it and have always been the computer guy in my family. If someone had problems with any kind of
          technology, I was usually the go-to guy. I realized I wanted to be a developer while I was at St. Louis Community College. I didn't
          know what I wanted to do, and didn't have much motivation to do the school work I was assigned.
          During this time, I had a Mechanical Engineering friend mention that he was working on a project that involved a string of LED lights
          that are synced to music that is playing. This idea sounded very interesting to me, so I decided to see if I could do it.
          I didn't really know where to start, other than knowing that my buddy was using an arduino, so I took to google and started researching.
          After borrowing an arduino and some supplies from a friend, and buying other supplies that I needed, I got to work.
          While working on this project, I had to learn many new things such as, how circuits works, how to solder, and how to connect software with the hardware.
          After a couple weeks of research, building, debugging, and tinkering, I finally had a working string of LEDs that would flash to the beat of music.
          During this project, I discovered a strong desire for software and coding. I found it really cool to be able to toy around with how the LEDs responded, unlike the circuits,
          that had to be built exactly correct, I was able to mess around with the code and get the LEDs to do different things.
          After building this project, I realized that programming could be something I do for a career and started teaching myself HTML/CSS/Javascript
          before I discovered and enrolled in Ranken Technical College. Outside of computers and technology, I am a near scratch golfer and
          played competitively up until college. On the weekends and in my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my
          friends, watching Netflix, and hitting the links with some buddies or family. Recently, I have found a new
          love for the sport of disc golf and play multiple times per week. If you have any specific
